Design Concepts for CSS Zen Garden - Kaleidoscope

I like to create really colorful environments in my installation art, and often incorporate kaleidoscopes or prisms--so I thought I would bring that feeling to my css zen garden. In my installations I like to use dreamy colors or textures and bring an element of surprise. For my zen garden I want to utilize transparency and hover to embody that dreaminess and give a sense of impermanence, while still maintaining clear organization and intuitive layout. 

Some inspirational zen gardens:

http://csszengarden.com/109/ This one has really great use of animation on the nav and a great layout
